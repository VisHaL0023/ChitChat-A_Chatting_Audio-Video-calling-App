## **Reflection**

This was a 3 week long project built during the Lockdown Period. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to chat with each other, Then i started learing about firebase which can store realtime data which is the core of this app. 

One of the main challenges I ran into was showing the call screen when user call. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into retrofit library and Firebase Cloud Messaging.

Thank You for Reading and Visiting, Have A Nice Day!
